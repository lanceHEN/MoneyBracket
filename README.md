# MoneyBracket

This program scrapes data from kenpom.com to simulate as many March Madness tournaments as you like, with the ultimate goal of finding the most profitable bracket configuration (assuming you use p points = s * 2^r scoring, where s is the seed and r is the round, starting with 0). This requires you to copy and paste the kenpom HTML code onto a local file on your machine. You must then insert its path in the path = "insert kenpom html file path here" line. You can then simulate as many tournaments as you want, with each number on the screen representing one tournament. Enjoy!
