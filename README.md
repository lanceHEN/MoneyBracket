# MoneyBracket

Every March, the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament begins, and millions of people across the world compete against one another to pick the best March Madness bracket. Rather than attempting to find the most accurate bracket, this program will try to find whichever bracket will yield the most POINTS for leagues where more points are rewarded to those who correctly pick higher seeds to win.

This program scrapes data from kenpom.com, using it to simulate as many March Madness tournaments as you like, with the ultimate goal of finding the most profitable bracket configuration in your pool (assuming you use p points for every correct pick = s * 2^r scoring, where s is the seed and r is the round, starting with 0). This requires you to copy and paste the kenpom HTML code onto a local file on your machine. You must then insert its path in the path = "insert kenpom html file path here" line. You can then simulate as many tournaments as you want, with each number on the screen representing one tournament. Enjoy!
